#Summary: Provide code to 4 questions in R Script and upload to Github.
#======================================================================================
#1. Reading in two files (delimited differently) that have dates using two different
#   date formats.
#2. Quoting from the RMarkdown page (http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) "They can be
#   automatically regenerated whenever underlying R code or data changes."
#3. Just because something is correlated (such as something showing correlation
#   on a scatterplot) doesn't mean one causes the other.
#4. From my experience variable coding is helpful when you have column names stored
#   in a variable and you need to change just certain ones while maintaining other, or
#   changing a factor name while maintaining the others.
